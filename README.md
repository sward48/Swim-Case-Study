# Swim-Case-Study

In order to run this app and render the pdf files, you must follow these instructions:

First, ensure you have all the required packages by checking libraries.R. If you have all the packages installed, then you should be good to run and render. (If you have all the libraries and are still having trouble rendering the .qmd files, you should be able to render as HTML, then from there save as a PDF).

The only other step required is to have the proper folder structure.

The folder structure is as follows:


```text
swim-case-study/
├── app.R
├── R/ 
│   ├── libraries.R
│   ├── prepdata.R
│   ├── analysis.R
├── data/      
│   ├── Rawdata.csv
│   ├── Data.rds
├── swimming_report.qmd
└── executive_summary.qmd
```
